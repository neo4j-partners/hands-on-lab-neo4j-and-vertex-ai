    "## Fine Tuning for Cypher Generation\n",
    "We encourage you to use Vertex AI Codey family models with a schema, few-shot examples, and precise prompt engineering for Cypher generation. However, if that still doesn't provide an appropriate level of quality, or you need your LLM to improve accuracy on a more specific task area, you can try fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is the process of taking a foundational model and making precise changes to improve its performance for a specific, narrower task. It works by taking in training data containing many examples of your specific task and using it to update or add additional parameters in a new version of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total training time generally takes more than an hour. The tuned adapter model is going to stay within your tenant, and your training data will not be used to train the base model, which is frozen. Tuning runs on GCP's TPU infrastructure that is optimized to run ML workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data should be structured as a supervised training set, where each row contains input text and desired, resulting, Cypher query. Vertex AI expects you to adhere to the below format in a `jsonl` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"input_text\": \"MY_INPUT_PROMPT\", \"output_text\": \"CYPHER_QUERY\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can find more about fine-tuning in the [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/models/tune-models)\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we went through the steps of connecting a LangChain agent to a Neo4j database and using it to generate Cypher queries in response to user requests via LLMs on Vertex AI, thus grounding the LLM with a knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we used the `code-bison` model here, this approach can be generalized to other Vertex AI LLMs.  This process can also be augmented with additional steps around the generation chain to customize the experience for specific use cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The critical takeaway is the importance of Neo4j Knowledge Graph as a grounding database to: \n",
    "* Anchor your chatbot to reality as it generates responses and \n",
    "* Enable your LLM to provide answers enriched with relevant enterprise data."
